# weather-app

**The common functionalities are:**
* The user can see weather for various cities
* The user can track and untrack the weather for saved cities
* The user can see the hourly/weekly/daily forecast for cities

I'm using [openweather Api](url) to get weather metrics and [Mabbox API](url) to get coordinates for cities bases of city names

**Built With**
* Vue
* Node js
* Express js
* Tailwind css
